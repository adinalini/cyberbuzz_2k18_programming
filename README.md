# cyberbuzz_2k18_programming

An interactive quiz that I made for the programming event in our annual school symposium.

It had time penalty for wrong answers, passwords for unlocking next levels and folders, points to skip questions and gamble away, lockdown for lying (really), in short everything cool ^ ^
